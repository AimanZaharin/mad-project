## **Project Objectives**  

1. **Efficient Use of Widgets**  
   - Utilize Flutter’s widget-based architecture to create modular, reusable, and scalable UI components (e.g., book cards, navigation bars, buttons).  

2. **Integration of HTTP Library for Data Fetching**  
   - Implement the HTTP package to fetch book data, images, and other relevant information from an external API, ensuring real-time updates.  

3. **Authentication System with Firebase/API**  
   - Set up Firebase Authentication or an API-driven authentication system to manage user sign-ups, logins, and account security.  

4. **Proper Page Routing and Navigation**  
   - Implement structured navigation using Flutter’s `Navigator` system for smooth transitions between pages (home, book details, user profile, etc.).  

5. **Responsive and Well-Designed Layouts**  
   - Use Flutter’s layout widgets (`Column`, `Row`, `Expanded`, `Flexible`, `Stack`) to ensure proper UI alignment, responsiveness, and a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
